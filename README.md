# Chat-bot-dash
The Dash app is created with a container layout and a centered heading displaying "CHAT IN DASH". Users can input their messages in the text box and click the submit button. The app then sends the user input to the GPT-3.5 Turbo model via the OpenAI API and displays the generated response in real-time.
